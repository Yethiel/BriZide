## Game Outline

### Story
Project Bright Side was initiated by the Global Space Program in the year 2353. Its aim was to relocate humanity to inhabit planets far from home due to earth's long exhausted resources. A large cubic space ship has been built, equipped with everything to keep the population inside occupied and save. For many centuries, the inhabitants were able to maintain a rather regular life until situations in the cube changed. Resources have gone down to a minimum. The outbreak of a war is a plausible.

### Gameplay
Players compete with anti-gravity ships in races and combat events.
A huge focus lies on track creation. The game features a track editor that can be used to easily create stages for the game.

## Game Elements

### Game Modes
+ Checkpoint Racing/Time Trial
+ Puzzle/Pathfinding
+ Combat

### Tracks
Tracks will feature a wide variety of building blocks, many of which have special features.
+ Portals
+ Gravity inverters
+ Speed pads
+ Many chicanes, twists and turns

Tracks can be build to be used as battle arenas, puzzle or trial courses, as well as race tracks.

### Ships
#### Handling
The ships handle fairly straightforward. Each ship is equipped with a stabilizer that prevents the ship from drifting. Drifting by disabling the stabilizer is a key to successful and fast navigation of the tracks.

#### Stabilizer
The stabilizer is charged by the speed of the ship. When the stabilizer is temporarily disabled, it stores a small amount of energy. That energy will be released when the stabilizer is turned back on, thrusting the ship in the direction it's going.
This allows for faster sharp turns or little speed boosts.

### Hub World
The hub world is there for players to explore large parts of the cube and find collectibles. Inside the cube they'll find highways, buildings, factories and forests.
