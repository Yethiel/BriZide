# Levels

Level files can be found in the `levels` folder. Every level is a `.json` file which can be edited with a regular text editor.

## Creating Levels with Blender

BriZide comes with a level editor add-on for Blender 2.79. You can find it in the `brizide-addon` folder.

To install the addon, you have to copy it to your Blender folder.

### Installation on GNU/Linux

Create the folder `~/.config/blender/2.79/scripts/addons` and copy the `brizide-addon` folder into it.

### Installation on Windows

Locate your Blender folder, navigate to `2.79\scripts\addons` and copy the `brizide-addon` folder into it.

### Installation on macOS

I'm not exactly sure how that worked.
