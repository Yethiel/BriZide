## Story

> Project 'Bright Side' was initiated by the Global Space Program in the year 2353. Its aim was to relocate humanity to inhabit planets far from home due to earth's long exhausted resources. A large cubic space ship was built, equipped with everything to keep the population inside occupied and save. For many centuries, the inhabitants were able to maintain a rather regular life until situations in the cube changed. Resources have gone down to a minimum. Illegal races are probably the only thing left to maintain the social climate.
Current state: Keep bugs for yourself.
