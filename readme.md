# BriZide

BriZide is a free open-source racing game set in the distant future.
Players race ships on levels in a large cubic space ships.

The main focus of the project is fun and easy multi-player.
Many game modes are planned, including checkpoint races, combat, 
a Tron-like wall mode and battle tag. All modes are either team based 
or player versus player.
For single-player, the game will come with time-trial courses.

The handling is somewhere between Wipeout and F-Zero. Simple and predictable,
a bit floaty but not as arcade-y as F-Zero.

## Story

> Project 'Bright Side' was initiated by the Global Space Program in the year 2353. Its aim was to relocate humanity to colonize planets far from home due to earth's long exhausted resources. A large cubic space ship was built, equipped with everything to keep the population inside occupied and save. For many centuries, the inhabitants were able to maintain a rather regular life until situations in the cube changed. Resources have gone down to a minimum and the government was overthrown. Illegal races are probably the only thing left to maintain the social climate.
